Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be+AAoA-protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (+ACIA-Copyright and+AAoA-Related Rights+ACIA). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not+AAoA-limited to, the following:+AAoACgAA  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,+AAoA     communicate, and translate a Work;+AAoA ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);+AAoA-iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or+AAoA     likeness depicted in a Work;+AAoA iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,+AAoA     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;+AAoA  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data+AAoA     in a Work;+AAoA vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the+AAoA     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal+AAoA     protection of databases, and under any national implementation+AAoA     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such+AAoA     directive); and+AAoA-vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the+AAoA     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national+AAoA     implementations thereof.+AAoACgAA-2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention+AAoA-of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,+AAoA-irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of+AAoA-Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes+AAoA-of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as+AAoA-future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories+AAoA-worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or+AAoA-treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future+AAoA-medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,+AAoA-including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional+AAoA-purposes (the +ACIA-Waiver+ACIA). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each+AAoA-member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and+AAoA-successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to+AAoA-revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or+AAoA-equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public+AAoA-as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.+AAoACgAA-3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason+AAoA-be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the+AAoA-Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into+AAoA-account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the+AAoA-extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected+AAoA-person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,+AAoA-irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and+AAoA-Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the+AAoA-maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future+AAoA-time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number+AAoA-of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without+AAoA-limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the+AAoAIgAA-License+ACIA). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was+AAoA-applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any+AAoA-reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such+AAoA-partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder+AAoA-of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she+AAoA-will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related+AAoA-Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of+AAoA-action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's+AAoA-express Statement of Purpose.+AAoACgAA-4. Limitations and Disclaimers.+AAoACgAA a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,+AAoA    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.+AAoA b.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons+AAoA    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without+AAoA    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.+AAoA    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary+AAoA    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the+AAoA    Work.+AAoA d.
